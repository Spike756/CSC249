# Project Analysis Document: Delivery Route Optimization 
- Application Name: Delivery Route Optimization System
- Domain: Transportation

## Description
This application seeks to optimize delivery routes between a warehouse and customers. It calculates the most efficient path to minimize time and delivery costs. The application uses Dijkstra's algorithm by determining the shortest route in a weighted graph. The graph represents the delivery network of where nodes are locations, and edges are paths with weights as distance or travel costs.

## Key Capabilities and Requirements

### Key Capabilities: 
1. Graph of Delivery Network
- Nodes represent warehouses and customers.
- Edges present the connection between locations using weights as indication of travel costs or distance.

2. Shortest Path Calculation
- Uses Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the shortest route between the starting point and target location. 
- Starting point would be the warehouse and the target location would be the customer.
- Returns the most optimal route and total cost.
